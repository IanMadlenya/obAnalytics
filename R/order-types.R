##' Determine limit order types.
##'
##' This function infers order type given trade and order event data.
##' The following categories are assigned to the event data type field:
##' \describe{
##'   \item{unknown}{It was not possible to determine the order type}
##'   \item{flashed-limit}{An order which was created and at some future
##' time deleted without ever being hit}
##'   \item{resting-limit}{The order was added and left to rest in the
##' order book. it may or may not be hit later}
##'   \item{market-limit}{This is a limit order that crosses the book,
##' it's volume is filled until it's limit price is reached, at which
##' point the order comes to land in the book}
##'   \item{pacman}{This is a special type of (algorithmic) order executed
##' by the exchange (the order "eats" the best bid or ask at intervals
##' until filled.}
##'   \item{market}{This is an order that crosses the book, it's volume
##' is filled before it's limit price is reached (order never comes to
##' land in the book.) A market order is the most aggressive order type.}
##' }
##' @param events Limit order event data.
##' @param trades Execution data.
##' @return The limit order event data with updated type field.
